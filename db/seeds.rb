# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Style.create([
#     {name: 'Pale Ale'},
#     {name: 'IPA'},
#     {name: 'Ale'},
#     {name: 'Lager'},
#     {name: 'XPA'},
#     {name: 'Summer Ale'},
#     {name: 'Golden Ale'},
#     {name: 'Amber Ale'},
#     {name: 'Red Ale'},
#     {name: 'Brown Ale'},
#     {name: 'Wheat Beer'},
